# About the scripts

Sender of the message runs encryption_code.py to apply two layers of encryption to plain text and generates two files, ciphertext_1.txt and ciphertext_2.dat, which 
stores secret data and needs to be sent to the reciever of the message.The reciever of the message then runs decryption_code.py which requires those two files to 
decrypt the text. 

# Prerequisite

-> Pycryptodome

# Note

Run encryption_code.py first.For decryption_code.py to work,the user must have ciphertext_1.txt and ciphertext_2.dat stored in the same location,where 
decryption_code.py is stored.

# Compatibility

Works on both windows and linux.
